## Developer Notes

### Index Page
There are several index routes made to display either all recent posts, or filter them through the nav bar to only view posts of a certain topic.

### Show Page
The show Page will have a more in depth view of each post, and allow you to edit and delete the post the user is viewing. 

### New Page
Allows the user to create a new post

### Edit Page
Allows the user to edit the post in question

### Delete Page
Allows the user to delete the selected post

## Challenges

### The Search Bar
I am a little frustrated with my search bar, as I could not get it to function as intended. I will definitely have to spend more time looking into it in order to get it up and running. 

### User Sign in
I was also hoping to allow for user authentication and sign in, however, that seemed a bit out of reach the more I worked on my project.

## Successes

I had a lot of fun working on this project and getting everything to communicate together and have a working app. It was greate to get all the different routes to work, in addition to getting more focused index routes to look at only a select type of post.
